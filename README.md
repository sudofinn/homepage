# Sudofinn Personal Website
## About
This is my personal website. It uses ThreeJS to make the 3d part and  plain CSS for all the  animations.
The project was created with vite. 🧊

## About
I wanted to make a 3d website because it looks amazing.
The website has two cool features.
1. It is made with ThreeJS meaning that there are lots of 3d geometries. In one subsite, Orbit Control was also added.
2. It has some nice typewriter animations at the start and at the end. 🏞️

## Visit
The website should be available in a few hours. You can then find at probably at finnguha.dev . Thanks for checking out. 🚵

## Use
You can use part of the code for your own website. 👍
I also have used some OPEN SOURCE code.  🥾
For all the  open source code I have used that somebody else has original produced, I linked in the appropriate file to the github repo or the codepen. 🧗
